# Surf or Sleep 

# A Python app providing personalized surfing condition updates via email, helping users decide the best time to hit the waves.

Surf or Sleep is an innovative Python web application designed for surf enthusiasts seeking real-time updates on optimal surfing conditions. Leveraging web scraping techniques, the app gathers data on wave height, wind speed, and water temperature from reliable sources. Users can customize their preferences, and the app calculates a personalized score for each user based on their ideal surfing conditions. Automated emails are then sent to users each morining at 6am PST letting each user know if they should surf or sleep that day which in turn creates a seamless and tailored surfing experience.
